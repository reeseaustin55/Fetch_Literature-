# Bibliography PDF Downloader

This project provides a Tkinter desktop application that accepts bibliography
entries, extracts DOI/URL links, and uses Selenium to download the
corresponding PDF files. Microsoft Edge (Chromium) is used by default, with an
option to switch to Google Chrome if desired.

## Features

- Paste bibliography text into a convenient GUI window.
- Choose the destination folder for downloaded PDFs (defaults to a
  `Bibliography_PDFs` folder on the desktop).
- Select between Edge and Chrome browsers.
- Automated Selenium workflow that opens each DOI/URL, locates PDF download
  buttons, and saves the files to the chosen folder.
- Activity log embedded in the UI for easy progress tracking.

## Running the Application

1. Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed along with the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python bibliography_downloader.py
   ```

3. Paste your bibliography, adjust settings as needed, and click **Download
   PDFs**.

## Requirements

The application relies on the following packages:

- `selenium`
- `webdriver-manager`
- `requests`
- `tkinter` (included with standard Python installations on most platforms)

Ensure that Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome is installed locally for the
respective Selenium driver to control.
