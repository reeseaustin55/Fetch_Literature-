# Fetch Literature PDFs

This repository provides a small Tkinter + Selenium utility that can automate downloading PDFs referenced in a bibliography.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Firefox browser (since Chrome is not available)
- `geckodriver` available on your system `PATH`
- Python dependencies: `selenium`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Usage

1. Run the script (for example from PyCharm):

   ```bash
   python fetch_pdfs.py
   ```

2. Paste bibliography entries into the text box. Entries can be separated by blank lines **or** by numbering such as `[1]`, `(2)`, or `3.`â€”the parser will split them accordingly.
3. Choose the destination folder for the downloaded PDFs (defaults to a folder on your Desktop).
4. Click **Download PDFs**. The application will launch Firefox, search each reference on Google Scholar, follow the first result, download the associated PDF, and save it into the chosen folder. Each file is named after the detected study title when possible (falling back to a numeric sequence otherwise).
5. When finished, a summary dialog displays the results. Any references that fail
   on the first pass are automatically retried once more before the summary is
   shown. If any PDFs still cannot be downloaded, a `missing_pdfs.txt` report is
   written to the destination folder listing the references and the reason they
   were skipped.

Downloads occur through Firefox so they retain any session-based access you have in your browser profile.
