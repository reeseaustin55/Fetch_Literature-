# Fetch Literature PDFs

This repository provides a small Tkinter + Selenium utility that can automate downloading PDFs referenced in a bibliography.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Firefox browser (since Chrome is not available)
- `geckodriver` available on your system `PATH`
- Python dependencies: `selenium`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Usage

1. Run the script (for example from PyCharm):

   ```bash
   python fetch_pdfs.py
   ```

2. Paste bibliography entries into the text box. Entries can be separated by blank lines **or** by numbering such as `[1]`, `(2)`, or `3.`—the parser will split them accordingly.
3. Choose the destination folder for the downloaded PDFs (defaults to a folder on your Desktop) and, if desired, adjust the per-reference download timeout (30 seconds by default). Enable **Offer manual browser fallback for missed PDFs** if you would like the app to prompt you once with instructions for finishing any stubborn downloads yourself.
4. Click **Download PDFs**. The application will launch Firefox, search each reference on Google Scholar, follow the first result, download the associated PDF, and save it into the chosen folder. Each file is named after the detected study title when possible (falling back to a numeric sequence otherwise). Use the **Skip ▶** control if you need to manually advance to the next reference without waiting for the active attempt to finish.
   - If Google Scholar interrupts with a verification step (for example an “I'm not a robot” challenge), the app pauses and shows a dialog. Complete the verification manually in Firefox and press **OK** to continue.
5. When finished, a summary dialog displays the results. Any references that fail
   on the first pass are automatically retried once more before the summary is
   shown. If any PDFs still cannot be downloaded, a `missing_pdfs.txt` report is
   written to the destination folder listing the references and the reason they
   were skipped.

   - If the manual fallback option is enabled, the app opens the remaining
     references in your default browser and watches your **Downloads** folder
     for a new PDF for up to 20 seconds per reference. As soon as a file appears
     there, it is moved into the chosen destination and renamed to match the
     reference title. The confirmation instructions only appear the first time
     manual fallback runs during a session.

Downloads occur through Firefox so they retain any session-based access you have in your browser profile.
