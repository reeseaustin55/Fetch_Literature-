# Fetch Literature PDFs

This repository provides a small Tkinter + Selenium utility that can automate downloading PDFs referenced in a bibliography.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Firefox browser (since Chrome is not available)
- `geckodriver` available on your system `PATH`
- Python dependencies: `selenium`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Usage

1. Run the script (for example from PyCharm):

   ```bash
   python fetch_pdfs.py
   ```

2. Paste bibliography entries into the text box. The script will automatically detect DOIs or direct URLs.
3. Choose the destination folder for the downloaded PDFs (defaults to a folder on your Desktop).
4. Click **Download PDFs**. The application will launch Firefox, navigate to each DOI/URL, click the first PDF link it finds, and save the file into the chosen folder.
5. When finished, a summary dialog displays the results.

Downloads occur through Firefox so they retain any session-based access you have in your browser profile.
